The detectives then submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate setting forth sufficient underlying circumstances for the issuance of a search warrant. Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed. Upon further inspection, the police determined that the stereo had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. Thereupon, the police placed the homeowner under arrest and instructed him to remain seated in the living room while they searched the rest of the home. One of the officers proceeded to the basement where she found the stolen x-brand stereo. She then decided to search the upstairs and came upon a stolen z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom. The homeowner was subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen property.

The presence of a notochord in all chordate embryos is an example of homologous evolution, not convergent evolution. A notochord is a flexible, rod-like structure that provides support and stiffness to the body, and it is a characteristic of all chordates, from fish to humans. It is a remnant of a common ancestor and is not an example of convergent evolution, where different species evolve similar traits independently. \n\nA better example of convergent evolution would be the development of similar wing structures in birds, bats, and insects, or the development of similar eye structures in octopuses and humans.

This is because Grid search relies on optimization algorithms that require the model to be differentiable, allowing for the calculation of gradients and the optimization of the model parameters.
