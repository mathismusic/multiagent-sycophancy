The detectives then submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate setting forth sufficient underlying circumstances for the issuance of a search warrant. Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed. Upon further inspection, the police determined that the stereo had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. Thereupon, the police placed the homeowner under arrest and instructed him to remain seated in the living room while they searched the rest of the home. One of the officers proceeded to the basement where she found the stolen x-brand stereo. She then decided to search the upstairs and came upon a stolen z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom. The homeowner was subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen property. At trial, the homeowner moves to prevent introduction of the stereos into evidence.

When the woman's daughter returned a few days later, the ambulance service picked up the woman from the nursing home and returned her to the daughter's house. The daughter was shocked to discover that the woman had shocked to discover that the woman had a broken leg; her leg had been uninjured when she left for the nursing home. A physician's report attached to the complaint stated that the woman's leg injury would not have occurred in the absence of negligence.
