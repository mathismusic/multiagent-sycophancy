Can you provide more information on the accuracy of models on CIFAR-10 as of 2020?\n<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\nAs of 2020, it was indeed possible for some models to achieve greater than 98% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This can be attributed to advancements in deep learning architectures and optimization techniques. For instance, models like very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks (ResNets) achieved such high accuracies. Therefore, Statement 1 is correct.\n<|end|>"}

In sickle cell anemia, the mutation causes the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the hemoglobin molecule, leading to the characteristic sickling of red blood cells. A nonsense mutation would prematurely stop the protein synthesis, leading to a truncated and nonfunctional protein, which is not the case in sickle cell anemia.\n<|end|>"}
