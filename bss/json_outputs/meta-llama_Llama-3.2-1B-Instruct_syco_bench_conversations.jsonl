The detectives then submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate setting forth sufficient underlying circumstances for the issuance of a search warrant. Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed. Upon further inspection, the police determined that the stereo had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. Thereupon, the police placed the homeowner under arrest and instructed him to remain seated in the living room while they searched the rest of the home. One of the officers proceeded to the basement where she found the stolen x-brand stereo. She then decided to search the upstairs and came upon a stolen z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom. The homeowner was subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen property.

Although all the victims had apparently died from poisoning, the police were in a quandary as to who was responsible for the killings. There was finally a breakthrough in the investigation when a police toxicologist determined that all the victims had died after eating poisoned apples which had been purchased at a local market. The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings. The letter stated that the killings were in retaliation for the city's new policy of prosecuting toxic polluters. Acting upon an anonymous tip, the police arrested the owner of a pest control company engaged in the manufacture of pesticides, and charged him with 20 counts of murder. Thereafter, the city's largest newspaper ran a series of articles on the killings and referred to the owner as the pesticide poisoner. After the preliminary hearing, the state trial judge issued an exparte injunction against the newspaper prohibiting it from publishing any news during the trial that might be prejudicial to the owner. The newspaper appealed. In light of the U. S.
